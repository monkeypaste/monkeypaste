Steps to access features, modes, or content that may be hidden, conditional, or locked/limited:

Steps to observe 'Free' subscription limitation:
1. Complete initial Welcome wizard, either by clicking 'Skip' or click through the options via the 'Next' button and then finally click the 'Done' button 
2. After copying more than 5 pieces of content (text, images or group of files) from any application (within reason, notepad would be a suitable one for testing),
   the total storage will be restricted to 5 items (without 'Basic' or 'Unlimited' subscription), so the first added clip will be moved to the trash when the 6th one is added.

Steps to verify background audio usage:
Audio playback volume is set to 0 by default (treated as muted). To hear it
1. open the Settings window (accessed from cog icon at top-left of the main window or right-clicking system tray icon and selecting 'Settings').
2. select the "Preferences" tab (should be by default) then scroll to the "Sound" panel and increase the volume slider of "Notification Volume"
3. A sample audio clip will play at selected volume

Dependencies on other products:
None
