# Overview

To be as accessible as possible **all** features are fully available in the 3 account levels that MonkeyPaste supports. However to monetize this effort and [maintaining your privacy as an upmost precedent](../security/privacy.md) MonkeyPaste uses [content *recycling*](recycling.md) to limit its internal storage based on the account type.

:::tip Linux is free
As a nod to Linux and free-for-use software in general, MonkeyPaste will default to the *'Unlimited'* account plan for **free on all Linux platforms.**
