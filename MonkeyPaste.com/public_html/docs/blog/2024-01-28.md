Getting this app out has been an epic journey on many fronts. I've been telling myself for MONTHS "I'm almost there...just a couple more things" and after a while those words just become sounds, like a joke I would have to be crazy to think was funny. But I **really** am *just* about ready to brace for impact (or lack thereof) with this thing, MonkeyPaste. I'm estimating it should be out and available by next week...

As usual, I'm at the office. In my van at good ol' Walmart in beautiful Front Royal, Virginia! At least for today that's where I am ;) But today is *different*! My to-do list(s) are nearly bare, its raining out and I'm pretty sure I *would* go crazy if I kept grinding on this project any longer. Enough is enough and MonkeyPaste is enough now *I think* at least but really I have **no idea**. 

No one and I mean no one besides myself has ever even **seen** this app! I'm flying completely blind here but that's ok. Somebody will try it out right? You maybe? Did you try it? I hope you like it ;)

Anyhow I have lots (and lots) of plans for MonkeyPaste and my little LLC. "Monkey" but all that must wait. This project has come *really far* but its foolish to keep working at something no one has used or even knows about, the waters must be tested so-to-speak. See you soon!
