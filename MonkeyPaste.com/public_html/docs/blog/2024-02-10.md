I'm just now wrapping up localizing all of MonkeyPaste's 43,235 characters of text. Which doesn't *sound*
like all that much but when you want to localize something to as many languages as possible the amount of data becomes **staggering**:

|Total Languages|Total Dialects|Total Text|
|---|---|---|
|76|173|5,576,655 characters|

That's **a lot** of text! 

I only speak English so almost all of it is just jibberish to my ignorant American brain. Which is pretty **scary** trusting [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) with everything. But I am poor and this translation stuff gets **expensive**. Even using AI! (**very**) Thankfully  I found a free Google API (its probably more like an old backdoor) that some hero on github posted about. So its free!! After working out some code to batch up requests, it only takes a few hours to translate everything.

I just have to keep reminding myself *do not be afraid* of the endless list of things that could go wrong. What's the point? I try to antipicate what I can and at the end of the day its just a *clipboard manager* so **what's the worst that can** ***happen???*** Famous last words right? Maybe so but I shrug it off and forge ahead!

Last step now is getting the app in the cloud (on Microsoft Store) and testing an install on a clean machine. *Hopefully* thats the last step if nothing goes wrong that is...
