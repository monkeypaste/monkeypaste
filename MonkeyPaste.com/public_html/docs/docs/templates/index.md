# Templates

Text templates are special regions of text clips that allow you to *reuse* a clip like a **snippet**. 

## Creating a Template
Open a *Text* clip for editing (Control+E or click the button in the bottom-right corner of the tile) and select the üè∑Ô∏è button from toolbar as seen below:
<p class="figure">
  <img src={require('/img/templates_editor_add_menu.png').default} />  
</p>

## Types
There are a few types of templates currently supported and more to come!


|Type|Info|Shared|
|---|---|---|
|Static| A snippet of text shared across **all clips** and **all instances** that reference it. | ‚úÖ|
|Date Time| A shared date and/or time **format** so when a clip is **pasted** or **drag-and-dropped** that format will be used against the **current time** |‚úÖ|
|Dynamic| A snippet **only** used within one clip|‚ùå|

:::info Shared Templates Properties
When a *shared template* is created in the *Text Clip Editor* it becomes available to **all** text clips. Any changes made to a *shared template* will also propagate to **all clips**.
:::

:::warning Deleting Shared Templates
After you create a *shared template*, it will remain available even if you delete all references to it (unlike a *dynamic template*). 

The **only** way to delete a *shared template* is by clicking the **Delete All** button from the *template properties panel* as seen below:

<p class="figure">
  <img src={require('/img/templates_delete_shared.png').default} />  
</p>

## Use Examples
You maybe wondering *well what's the point!?* about these templates, well I can understand that. Here's a few examples when they could be helpful:

- Boiler-plate emails. If you made a clip of an email you send all the time that's great use case for template snippets. You could create a 'My Signature' *Static Template* for the footer and a 'Todays Date' *Date Time Template* that could be used in the header. 
- Code Snippets. If you have a block of code you use often you could turn the variable names, etc. into *dynamic template*'s so you could use it as snippet *anywhere* unlike a snippet system for a specific IDE for example.


## Coming Soon
There's a few types of experimental templates being developed which could be added if enough interest arises, primarily *Contact Templates*

### Contacts
Like a *Date Time Template* uses a **format** against the current time. A *Contact Template* would use a **contact property** (like name, address, phone number, etc.) against a contact from your email service (Gmail or outlook currently). 

This would allow you to paste some common email you need just by selecting the persons name from the *paste toolbar*. 

## Thoughts and Feedback
This idea of *Text Templates* is somewhat novel (I've never seen anyhing that does this). And I don't know how much interest people will have with them but if you have any ideas or suggestions, I'd love to hear them!
