# Free Account Tips (depracted)

:::danger MonkeyPaste is Freeware now
Subscriptions have been removed (as of 1.0.15.0) and there are **no longer any capacity limits** ðŸŽ‰

This page is just here for posterity now.
:::
There's a few settings designed to help make the _Free-to-use_ mode a bit more user-friendly but they aren't enabled by default. They are described below.

## On-Demand clipboard listening

By pausing the clipboard listener (by clicking _System Tray->Pause_ or <kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>F1</kbd>) a ðŸŽ¯ icon will appear in the top-right of the _Pin Tray_ **when there is something** **_new_** on the clipboard.

<p><img class="figure narrow" src={require('/img/free_acct_sug_bullseye_btn.png').default} /></p>

Now the **_only_** time MonkeyPaste will read the clipboard is when you click the ðŸŽ¯ button or the <kbd>Control</kbd><kbd>Shift</kbd><kbd>F9</kbd> global shortcut.

:::tip Set it in stone
If you like keeping the _Clipboard Listener_ paused, you can uncheck _Settings->Preferences->Listen To Clipboard On Startup_ to avoid having to pause it everytime you use MonkeyPaste.

## Capacity Hints & Watermarks

- Capacity notifications can be permanently hidden from the 3 dots menu
- Cap clip watermark warnings can be hidden by checking _Settings->Preferences->Hide Capacity Watermarks_

## Transitioning from a free-trial

If you tried the _Unlimited_ plan and decided not to pay for it you'll probably have a fair amount of entries stored up. To keep this monetization method afloat the cap system **ensures things added to your storage with the** **_paid plan_** **are not lost to recycling**.

So let's say you had 100 clips at the end of the trial. Then your capacity won't _ever_ go over 100 after that, **but** to prevent giving trial users a **rolling** storage of 100 items, the cap system picks clips **on or after the trial ends** which _may_ make organizing your stuff pretty confusing, I get that but there's not much that can be done beyond the tip below...

:::tip Clean slate
You can delete your storage at any time from _Settings->Preferences->System->Delete All Clips_
