# Free Account Tips

By default with a free account, this clip capacity stuff can get pretty frustrating but there's a few settings that can help make that restrictions a bit more *user-friendly*.

## On-Demand clipboard listening

By pausing the clipboard listener, *System Tray->Pause* a ðŸŽ¯ icon will appear in the top-right of the *Pin Tray* when there is something **new** on the clipboard. 
<p><img class="figure narrow" src={require('/img/free_acct_sug_bullseye_btn.png').default} /></p>

:::tip 
You can uncheck *Settings->Preferences->Listen To Clipboard On Startup* to **always** have the clipboard listener be paused.

Now the ***only*** time MonkeyPaste will read the clipboard is when you click the ðŸŽ¯ button.

## Capacity Hints & Watermarks

- Capacity notifications can be permanently hidden from the 3 dots menu 
- Cap clip watermark warnings can be hidden by checking *Settings->Preferences->Hide Capacity Watermarks*

## Transitioning from free-trial

If you tried the *Unlimited* plan and didn't decide to pay for it (you *dirty dog you*) you'll probably have a fair amount of entries stored up. To keep this monetization method afloat the cap system **ensures things added to your storage with the paid plan aren not lost**. 

So let's say you had 100 clips at the end of trial. Your capacity won't go over 100 after that **but** to prevent giving trial users a **rolling** storage of 100 items, the cap system picks clips **on or after** the **trial ends** which *may* make organizing your stuff pretty confusing, I get that but there's not much that can be done beyond the tip below...

:::tip Fresh slate
You can delete your storage at any time from *Settings->Preferences->System->Delete All Clips*
