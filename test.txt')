-drag over no-select shouldn't show paste toolbar
-drag leave should disable sel if was no sel on drag enter

-add min-delay for end paste state change in editor (1s)
-title not unhiding (may also be a template thing)
-on first tag select it scrolls to end not to first item (i think this is from templates in query page somehow)
